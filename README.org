** Introduction

This package adds syntax highlighting to the Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eshell/][Eshell]]. It highlights user commands at the interactive prompt to provide feedback on the validity of commands and syntax.

This package is inspired by [[https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting][zsh-syntax-highlighting]] and the native highlighting of [[https://fishshell.com/][fish]].

** Installation

This package is installable through [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA]]. After setting up the MELPA package archive, install with

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x package-install RET eshell-syntax-highlighting RET
#+END_SRC


Alternatively, with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package eshell-syntax-highlighting
  :after eshell-mode
  :ensure t ;; Install if not already installed.
  :config
  ;; Enable in all Eshell buffers.
  (eshell-syntax-highlighting-global-mode +1))
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Use ~(eshell-syntax-highlighting-global-mode)~ to toggle highlighting in all future Eshell buffers.

You can toggle highlighting in an existing buffer with ~(eshell-syntax-highlighting-mode)~.

** Remote Directories

Since elisp in remote directories will run locally, high-latency [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][TRAMP]] connections can cause significant typing delays while the local Emacs session makes requests of the remote machine (such as searching the remote PATH, checking if remote files exist, etc.). Therefore, highlighting in remote directories is disabled by default. It can be enabled by setting ~eshell-syntax-highlighting-highlight-in-remote-dirs~ to ~t~.

** Customization

Faces in this package inherit from standard faces to match your theming. If this results in ambiguous highlighting (e.g. your ~font-lock-function-name-face~ is red), or if you just want to customize the coloring, you can use

    ~M-x customize-group eshell-syntax-highlighting~

to customize the faces used by this package.
